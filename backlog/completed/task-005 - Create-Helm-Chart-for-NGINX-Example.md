## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Package an example NGINX deployment as a Helm chart and ensure the chart can be installed on the local cluster provisioned by the project scripts.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Add a Helm chart under charts/nginx-example that deploys an NGINX Deployment with a Service exposing HTTP traffic.
- [x] #2 Provide default values and README guidance so the chart can be installed without additional configuration.
- [x] #3 Demonstrate installation by including a scripted or documented helm install command and a verification step that confirms the release is running.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Scaffold charts/nginx-example Helm chart with deployment, service, and configurable values for image, replicas, and service type.
2. Add chart README detailing install commands, default behavior, and configuration options; include verification steps.
3. Provide helper script or documented command sequence to install the chart onto the local cluster and validate the release status.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
- Scaffolded charts/nginx-example with minimal Deployment/Service and simplified values.
- Added chart README and root documentation covering install and verification commands.
- Validated chart structure with helm lint.

- Confirmed chart installs on local cluster and cleaned up with helm uninstall.
