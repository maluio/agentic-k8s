## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Modify the write_argocd function in agent/llm_tools/k8s.py to automatically commit file changes to git and push them. All git operations must run inside the container environment. Handle any git warnings or configuration issues that may arise (user.name, user.email, etc.).
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Function commits new/modified manifest files to git
- [x] #2 Function uses appropriate commit message mentioning the app name
- [x] #3 Function pushes changes to remote repository
- [x] #4 Git operations run inside the container
- [x] #5 Function handles git warnings gracefully
- [x] #6 Function returns git operation status in response message
- [x] #7 Function handles merge conflicts or push failures gracefully
- [x] #8 Commit message is clear and follows standard git conventions
- [x] #9 Git user.name is configured as 'k8s-agent' and user.email is properly set
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Review current write_argocd function implementation
2. Check git availability and configuration in container
3. Configure git user.name as "k8s-agent" and user.email
4. Add git operations to write_argocd function (add, commit, push)
5. Implement error handling for git operations
6. Test git commit with new manifest file
7. Test git push to remote repository
8. Handle potential conflicts and errors

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
## Summary

Updated `write_argocd` function to automatically commit and push changes to git after writing ArgoCD manifests to disk.

## Changes Made

- **Modified**: `agent/llm_tools/k8s.py`
  - Added git operations after writing manifest file
  - Configured git user.name as "k8s-agent" and user.email as "k8s-agent@localhost"
  - Added safe.directory configuration to handle repository ownership
  - Implemented git add, commit, and push workflow
  - Added comprehensive error handling for each git operation

## Implementation Details

**Git Configuration**:
- user.name: "k8s-agent"
- user.email: "k8s-agent@localhost"
- safe.directory: "/workspace" (to handle ownership mismatch)

**Workflow Steps**:
1. Write manifest file to disk
2. Configure git settings (if not already set)
3. Stage file with `git add`
4. Commit with message: "Add/update ArgoCD manifest for {app_name}"
5. Push to remote repository

**Error Handling**:
- Each git operation has independent error handling
- File write errors return immediately
- Git errors include descriptive messages indicating which step failed
- "Nothing to commit" case detected and handled gracefully
- Push failures (SSH key issues, network, etc.) reported clearly
- All git operations run in /workspace directory

**Return Messages**:
- Success: "Successfully wrote ArgoCD manifest to {app}.yaml, committed and pushed to repository"
- No changes: "ArgoCD manifest {app}.yaml already up to date (no changes to commit)"
- Partial success: Indicates which git step failed (add/commit/push)

## Testing

Verified the implementation:

- ✓ Git configuration commands execute successfully
- ✓ safe.directory configuration resolves ownership warnings
- ✓ File successfully written to agent/manifests/
- ✓ Git add stages the file correctly
- ✓ Git commit creates commit with k8s-agent author
- ✓ Commit message follows standard format
- ✓ Push operation executes (fails gracefully with SSH key message)
- ✓ Error messages are descriptive and helpful
- ✓ "Nothing to commit" case handled appropriately

## Known Limitations

- Git push requires SSH keys to be configured in the container
- Push failures are reported but don't prevent the function from returning success for write/commit
- The function will still report that write and commit succeeded even if push fails
