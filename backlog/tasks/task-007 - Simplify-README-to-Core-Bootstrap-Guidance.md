## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Streamline the repository README so it focuses on the project purpose, the bootstrap workflow, and an overview of the components the script provisions.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Rewrite README introduction to clearly state the repo purpose and how it relates to the bootstrap process.
- [x] #2 Condense README content to highlight only the bootstrap workflow, removing redundant installation sections.
- [x] #3 Add a concise list of components (e.g., K3s, Gitea, Argo CD, nginx example) that the bootstrap script installs for quick reference.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Review current README structure to identify redundant install instructions and clarify project purpose.
2. Rewrite README intro and bootstrap section to emphasize purpose, bootstrap usage, and provisioned components.
3. Validate final README flow for conciseness and ensure instructions remain accurate.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
- Rewrote README to focus on project purpose, one-step bootstrap workflow, and the components it provisions.
- Removed redundant manual install sections so bootstrap is the single entry point.
- Highlighted key URLs/credentials reported by the script and where port-forward logs land.
