## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Automate provisioning of a local K3s cluster so developers can bootstrap Kubernetes in a single step.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Create a script at scripts/install-k3s.sh that installs or upgrades K3s on the supported development OS and can be re-run safely.
- [ ] #2 Ensure the script starts the K3s service and writes kubeconfig details or export instructions for kubectl access.
- [ ] #3 Document script usage and prerequisites in the repository so a new developer can run it without additional guidance.
