## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Automate installation of the Helm command-line tool so developers can package and deploy charts on the local Kubernetes environment.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Provide a script at scripts/install-helm.sh that installs Helm at the pinned project version and leaves the binary accessible on PATH.
- [ ] #2 Include validation in the script that confirms helm version output matches the expected release.
- [ ] #3 Document how to run the script and any prerequisites so new developers can install Helm without additional guidance.
